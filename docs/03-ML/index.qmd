## Forecasting Expected Financial Returns

> Practicum Project, College of Engineering at the University of Oklahoma 

::: columns 
::: {.column width="55%"} 

This practicum applied machine learning to forecast a key economic indicator for investment strategy. Using LSTM, Elastic Net, and Prophet, LSTM delivered the strongest results, cutting out-of-sample error by ~10%. The workflow used vintage data, time-based validation, and feature engineering to reflect real-world constraints.

## Predicting Operational Delivery Times

> College of Engineering at the University of Oklahoma 

::: columns 
::: {.column width="55%"} 

This project built models to improve food delivery time estimates by integrating traffic, accidents, and weather with historical data. The approach reduced variance in arrival predictions versus baseline methods, creating a more reliable framework to support delivery services with better planning accuracy and operational consistency.
