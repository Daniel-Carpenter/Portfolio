### Education

I studied at the University of Oklahoma (2020), double-majoring in **Economics** and **Finance**, then earned a **Master’s in Data Science and Analytics** from OU’s **College of Engineering** (2023).

### Professional Experience

In 2021, I became an **Operational Performance & Analysis Advisor**, helping leaders across 25+ businesses improve efficiency and profitability. Two years later (2023), I joined the **Office of Investment Management & Strategic Finance as a Senior Advisor**, where I support a team of VP's through analysis of capital decisions to sustain programs and services.

### Personal Interests

You’ll find me in my vegetable garden, hiking with my wife and our two dogs, or out on a trail mountain biking or OneWheeling.
